The
club
isn't
the
best
place
to
find
a
lover
So
the
bar
is
where
I
go
mmmm
Me
and
my
friends
at
the
table
doing
shots
Drinking
fast
and
then
we
talk
slow
mmmm
And
you
come
over
and
start
up
a
conversation
with
just
me
And
trust
me
I'll
give
it
a
chance
now
mmmm
Take
my
hand
stop
put
Van
The
Man
on
the
jukebox
And
then
we
start
to
dance
And
now
I'm
singing
like
Girl
you
know
I
want
your
love
Your
love
was
handmade
for
somebody
like
me
Come
on
now
follow
my
lead
I
may
be
crazy
don't
mind
me
Say
boy
let's
not
talk
too
much
Grab
on
my
waist
and
put
that
body
on
me
Come
on
now
follow
my
lead
Come

on
now
follow
my
lead
mmmm
I'm
in
love
with
the
shape
of
you
We
push
and
pull
like
a
magnet
do
Although
my
heart
is
falling
too
I'm
in
love
with
your
body
Last
night
you
were
in
my
room
And
now
my
bedsheets
smell
like

Every

brand
new
I'm

story
begin
We're
going

You

thrifty
so

eat
Fill
up
your
bag
and
I
fill
up
a
plate
mmmm
We
talk
for
hours
and
hours
about
the
sweet
and
the
sour
And
how
your
family
is
doing
okay
mmmm
And
leave
and
get
in
a
taxi
then
kiss
in
the
backseat
Tell
the
driver
make
the
radio
play
And
